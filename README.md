# Next.js Image BlurHash Previewer

Next.js Image BlurHash Previewer is a utility tool designed to generate blur placeholders encoded in Base64 format, that could directly be used in Next.js Image `blurDataURL` prop.

Internally, this site uses the [blurhash library](https://github.com/woltapp/blurhash/tree/master/TypeScript) and [blurhash-base64 encoder](https://github.com/mcnaveen/blurhash-base64).
